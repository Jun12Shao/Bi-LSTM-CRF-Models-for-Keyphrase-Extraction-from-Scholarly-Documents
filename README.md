# Bi-LSTM-CRF-Models-for-Keyphrase-Extraction-from-Scholarly-Documents
This is our final project of the course "Probabilistic Graphical Models".
We try to reproduce the work of [Al-Zaidy et al.(2019)](https://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/pubs/WWW2019.pdf). Models were trained and tested on the scientific
document dataset KP that was provided by [Meng et al.(2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06879).

This Folder contains code of Bi_LSTM_CRF and evaluating results. 

###################Code of Bi_LSTM_CRF##################################

(1) Document-based model:
	training: run main_doc.py  , generate pretrained model.

	testing:  run test_doc.py   , generate evaluation results.

	plotting: run plotting.py for the evaluation results


(2) Sentence-based model:
	training: run main_sent.py  , generate pretrained model.

	testing:  run test_sent.py   , generate evaluation results.

	plotting: run plotting.py for the evaluation results

####### Intermediate results after testing and for plotting ##############

(1) Document-based model
	train_doc.csv : batch average precision, recall and f1-score on part of training set.
	valid_res.pkl : batch average precision, recall and f1-score on part of validation set.
	test_res.pkl  : batch average precision, recall and f1-score on part of test set.

(2)Sentence-based model
	train_sent.csv :     batch average precision, recall and f1-score on part of training set.
	valid_res_sent.pkl : batch average precision, recall and f1-score on part of validation set.
	test_res_sent.pkl  : batch average precision, recall and f1-score on part of test set.


The preprocessed dataset are organized in the following format.
